# Rectangle Evolution

My first ever attempt at creating a game in C++ when I was still in primary school. Kudos to you if you can figure out how to run the program. :-)

Jk, you can install the game by running the .exe provided in the corresponding game version and you will get a runnable .exe of the game. That's if you trust me not to install a virus on your PC: :)
